        <h5>About this project</h5>
        <p>In our studies as digital media students, and as creative people with strong ties to the art community, we have time and time again been introduced to, and ran into, level organizations with DIY principles. Examples of such DIY communities include the maker and hacker cultures, artist communities, collectives, and independent music groups. Combining all of them has been de-centralized process of production, where everyone takes part and does their best strengths. Anarchistic at times, it has in our experience often allowed for multiple voices to be heard as well as helped creative communities grow strong and prolific.</p>
        <p>Inspired by such flat hierarchies, we decided to opt out of the traditional process of filmmaking, where there is one absolute producer, one absolute director and so forth. We decided to, instead, share the production responsibility in regard to our individual strengths and skills. This meant for example Kyan doing all the musical production and communication towards the hip hop community, Silja planning the artistic direction and photography, and Kardelen taking the responsibility for the look and style.</p>
        <p>The result is the <i>Gesamtkunstwerk</i> known as SHOKWELLENRYDER: his visual identity, music video, creative direction, and seriously bad-ass music video.</p>
        <p>We hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed making it.</p>
